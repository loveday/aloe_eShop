= The Loveday & Yulia Online eStore

The domain/business chosen for this Project is Aloe Vera Health & Beauty Store. This is an e-commerce web application for Aloe Vera health and beauty products range available to purchase online.
Aloe Vera is used in a wide range of products, for example skin and hair care products, as well as beauty and make-up, Aloe Vera juice, supplements and nutrition, and more recently in household cleaners. In fact, the list of uses continues to grow as we rediscover why the Aloe Vera plant was so highly regarded in the first place, which nurtures a huge interest and provides a demand for these products on the market.
There are many Aloe Vera manufacturers of different brands available in the marketplace in our days.  For the purpose of this Project, we have chosen Aloe Vera products produced by Forever Living Products Company.
